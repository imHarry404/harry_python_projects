# Twitter bot using python3

Using python I created a bot that will do so much things with twitter.
It can retweet, like and auto reply where you were mentioned.
I have used tweepy library for this and you have to create your tweeter developer account and you must generate your api's and then after it will work for you.
thanks. :)




## To run the bot

download the file and open in terminal/cmd

```bash
  python3 filename.py
```
